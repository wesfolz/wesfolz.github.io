            I created a set of clues for her to solve. Some of the clues
            required her to enter answers to questions and for others she needed
            to go to specific destinations. The location-based clues would
            automatically unlock once her gps position showed she was close
            enough to the specific destination.

        I was planning to ask my girlfriend to marry me, but I wanted the
        proposal to be special and unique. I thought it would be a cool idea to
        send her on a scavenger hunt to different places that we like to spend
        time together. Thinking about the logistics of setting up the hunt
        seemed impractical and prone to errors, but then I realized that Iâ€™m an
        engineer, so I wrote software to handle the logistics for me.
